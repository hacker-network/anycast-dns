# SmartDNS + BIRD = Flexible DNS

Anycast recursive DNS service that can be deployed anywhere using [SmartDNS](https://pymumu.github.io/smartdns) + [BIRD](https://bird.network.cz). Inspired by [Lan Tian's anycast DNS](https://lantian.pub/article/modify-website/dn42-docker-anycast-dns.lantian/)

IP of instances deployed in my network are 172.23.13.126 and fdfd:4acc:e2:53::53. If you want to deploy this in your own network, change the IP addresses in the configuration files.
